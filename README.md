# Spotify-Data-Insights-with-AWS

This project **unleashes Spotify Data** using **AWS Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB**, leveraging real-time data.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Automated data collection** via AWS Lambda and S3  
- **Real-time price optimization** using historical sales and demand data  
- **Serverless architecture** for cost efficiency and scalability  
- **Integration with AWS DynamoDB** for fast data retrieval  
- **Customizable pricing strategies** based on business rules  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **AWS Services**: S3, Lambda, DynamoDB  
- **Machine Learning**: Python (Scikit-Learn, NumPy, Pandas)  
- **Backend**: FastAPI (for API endpoints)  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform  

---

## **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - AWS Lambda extracts real-time sales and market data.  
   - The data is stored in an **S3 bucket** for processing.  
2. **Data Processing & Storage**:  
   - AWS Lambda preprocesses data and stores it in **DynamoDB**.  
   - The cleaned data is used for price optimization.  
3. **Price Optimization Model**:  
   - A machine learning model predicts the optimal price based on demand.  
   - The model is triggered via Lambda and updates pricing recommendations.  
4. **API for Price Retrieval**:  
   - A **FastAPI endpoint** provides optimized price suggestions.

## **Setup Instructions**  
### **Prerequisites:**  
- AWS account with permissions for **S3, Lambda, DynamoDB**  
- Python 3.8+ installed locally  
- AWS CLI installed and configured  


---

## **How to Use**  
- Upload new sales data to **S3**, and AWS Lambda will process it automatically.  
- Query the API to receive **optimized pricing suggestions**.  
- Monitor **DynamoDB** for historical price recommendations.  

---

## **Future Improvements**  
- **Enhance machine learning models** for better accuracy.  
- **Deploy API to AWS Lambda** using AWS API Gateway.  
- **Incorporate real-time competitor pricing** for smarter pricing adjustments.
